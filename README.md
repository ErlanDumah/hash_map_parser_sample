## Self assessment

I would rate myself a solid 8 in terms of idiomatic code. I have recently been working with C++ a lot and expect that to have had an effect in one form or the other on my coding style.


## Assignments

The solutions for the two assignments are contained in `Q1` and `Q2`, respectively. Their respective README.md is meant as an entry point for the specifics of each.

For each solution, the code contains a large amount of comments, more than I would put in any production code. This is to explain a bit what was going on in my head when I designed the code structure.
